# Cloudtrailbeat
Version 0.1.0 ... *still beta*

## Overview
This is a beat for the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) service.  CloudTrailBeat relies on a combination of SNS, SQS and S3 to create a processing 'pipeline' to process new log events quickly and efficiently.  The beat polls the SQS queue for notification of when a new CloudTrail log file is available for download in S3.  Each log file is then downloaded, processed and sent to the configured receiver (logstash, elasticsearch, etc).  You are then able to query the data using Kibana (or any other tool) to analyse events involving API calls and IAM authentications.

## Getting Started
### Pre-built packages
Pre-built packages for a variety of systems are available on the [releases](https://github.com/buroa/cloudtrailbeat/releases) page.  This is the recommended method of installation.

### Building
These steps assume you already have a working [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install).

#### Requirements
* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.7
* [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) >= 0.10.0

```bash
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/buroa
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/buroa
git clone https://github.com/aidan-/cloudtrailbeat.git
cd cloudtrailbeat
glide install
glide update
make
```

### AWS Configuration
#### Pipeline configuration
Confguring CloudTrail is relatively straight forward and can be done quite easily through the AWS web console.  The [official documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html) outlines the steps required to configure everything, just ensure you complete the optional step 3.

If you would prefer to use CloudFormation to configure your environment, you can use the [provided template](etc/etc/cloudtrailbeat_cf.template.json) which will configure all of the neccessary services (CloudTrail, S3, SQS).   

Once configured, you can confirm everything is working by inspecting the configured S3 bucket as well as the SQS queue.

#### Access control configuration
CloudTrailBeat supports usage of both IAM roles and API keys, but as per AWS best practices, if CloudTrailBeat is being run from an EC2 you should be using IAM roles.  The following IAM Policy provides the minimal access required to process new CloudTrail events and initiate backfilling.  Make sure you replace the S3 and SQS ARN's with the values appropriate to your configuration.

```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3BucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket name here>"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowObjectRetrieval",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket name here>/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowSQS",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:DeleteMessage",
                "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
                "sqs:SendMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:sqs:<sqs arn here>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running Cloudtrailbeat
1. Make sure you have configured the neccessary AWS services (see AWS Configuration)
2. Install or build the latest version of Cloudtrailbeat
3. Modify the included *cloudtrailbeat.yml* file as required
  1. Replace the *sqs_url* field under the *input* section with the appropriate SQS URL
  2. Configure the *output* section to send the events to your logstash/elasticsearch instance.  More information on Beat output configuration can be found in the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html).
4. If you are not using IAM Roles to grant access to the SQS and S3 buckets, you will also need to configure *~/.aws/credentials* with the an appropriate key and secret.  The [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files) give a thorough explanation on setting up the required credentials files.
5. Run CloudTrailBeat in debug mode: `cloudtrailbeat -c /path/to/cloudtrailbeat.yml -e -d "*"`

You should now see a bunch of events scrolling through your terminal and in your output source.

If you are happy with the output, you will need to edit the configuration file to set `no_purge` to `false` (or delete the line).

### Backfilling
If you would like to backfill events that have been cleared from the SQS or expired, you can run CloudTrailBeat with the `-b` flag the name of the bucket that contains the CloudTrail logs.  Example:

`cloudtrailbeat -c /path/to/cloudtrailbeat.yml -d "*" -b example-cloudtrail-bucket`

If you would like to backfill only a subset of a bucket, you can also include the flag `-p` with the desired bucket prefix.  Example:

`cloudtrailbeat -c /path/to/cloudtrailbeat.yml -d "*" -b example-cloudtrail-bucket -f AWSLogs/xxxxx/CloudTrail/ap-northeast-1/2016/05`

## Thanks
This beat is heavily inspired by [AppliedTrust/traildash](https://github.com/AppliedTrust/traildash) with some updates and additional functionality.

## Todo
- Test cases
- Example Kibana configurations and Elasticsearch templates
